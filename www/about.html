<main>
  <p><strong>Remember to Eat</strong> is a meal-tracker application with a focus on <em>simplicity</em>.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.redbookmag.com/body/healthy-eating/advice/g614/lose-weight-apps-tools/">Existing meal-tracking apps</a> have too many steps, too many ads, and track too many things. Remember to Eat is laser-focused on energy (calories) and protein. And you can track your meals with a single button push.</p>

  <p>Remember to Eat also gives you an indication of how far along you are on today's "expected" energy and protein consumption, to encourage you to spread out your meals roughly evenly. This is useful for people who have trouble, well, remembering to eat. But it also prevents overeating (i.e., eating ahead of schedule), or getting too many calories without enough protein.</p>
