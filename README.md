# Remember to Eat

Remember to Eat is a hobby-project meal tracker. See it live at <https://remembertoeat.app>, and learn more on its [about page](https://remembertoeat.app/about).

This app is intentionally developed using cutting-edge technology and no build process, because it's my hobby project. Try Chrome Canary for best results.
