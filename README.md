# Remember to Eat

This is a hobby project I'm working on that helps me track calories and protein throughout the day. Unlike other apps of its kind, it's meant to be super-simple, with minimal clicks. It's basically aimed directly at me for now, although it could be fun to make it usable for others too.

This app is intentionally developed using cutting-edge technology and no build process, because it's my hobby project. Try Chrome Canary for best results.
